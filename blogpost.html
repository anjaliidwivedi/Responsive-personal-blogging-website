            <h1>Home Decor</h1>
            <p>
                Hello readers!  </p>
                <p>Well we all our fortunate and privileged enough if we have shelter. And that shelter becomes home when we give it our touch in its interior and décor. Many of us love to give their own essence so that home doesn’t remain only of concrete but also of love and creativeness. Decorating your house is actually thrilling and best place to showcase your aesthetic ideas .So here are few brain waves that can actually lighten up your boring looking home to result of creative ideas.</p>
                <p>1)  CREATE A GALLERY WALL</p>
                <p>Instead of putting pictures of your childhood or your family pictures in separate frames in different rooms/showcases, you can put them collectively on a single wall. You can choose any wall according to your taste and comfort. It can even be random pictures or motivational quotes set up in frames of different shape and sizes. Try to put them in order. Follow single or contrasting color pattern frames. Opt for simple, cohesive frames and wall hangings.

                </p>
                <p>2) COMFY READING AREA</p>
                <p>Books are human’s best friend. Then why not creating a comfortable place to sit and read with a small library beside. All your books which are packed in your bag or are somewhere lying down can actually be helpful in home décor. You can use small floating shelves to put books. They can save space and look classy. Keeping a couch with lamp beside can be a wonderful completion of personal library.</p>
                <p>3) BRING IN PLANTS</p>
                <p>Plants are very good source of energy and positivity. Bring beautiful small flowery/non flowery plants and bring a bit of nature into your house. You can even hang them with beautiful hangings. You can further decorate them with ferry or string lights. But remember to take proper care of them.</p>
                <p>4) FABRIC ON WALL</p>
                <p>A tapestry or wall hanging can add color and pattern, as well as a sense of softness to a space. Consider framing vintage scarves or other pretty textiles. These are a lot easier to move than framed paintings when it comes time to head to your next home</p>
                <p>5) HANG MIRRORS</p>
                <p>This is personally my favorite idea of home décor. Having a single mirror in your house that to only in dressing room is now kinda out of trend. Hanging mirrors of different shapes and sizes looks beautiful. You can even put oversized plane mirror as the aesthetic part or saloon style several small pieces. You can decorate it more with ferry lights. Mirrors reflect light so they can make small place look bigger.
